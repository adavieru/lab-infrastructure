copy-check utility for detecting plagiarism using Moss.
	(http://cs.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/)

= Usage steps =

I. Copy/sync assignment files locally

Files are stored in the `store/' folder. You should create a folder
identifying the year of study.

You may use the `util/sync-assignments.sample' script. I recommend
copying it to the "year of study" folder, updating and running it.

II. Reset generated data

Generated data from a previous run should be removed. Use the `0-reset'
script:
	./0-reset

You may also use the script for "resetting" generated data for a single
assignment.
	./0-reset 1lin

III. Select files to be submitted to Moss

In case this is the first time you run copy-check for that year of
study, update the `select_*' function in the `1-select' script
accordingly. Each function selects source code files (usually C and C++)
that are going to be submitted to Moss.

Run the script:
	./1-select

If you only want to select files pertaining to a given assignment, pass
the assignment identifier to the script:
	./1-select 1lin

Files are, by default, stored in the `moss-input/' folder. A subfolder
is created for each assignment (`1lin', `1win' etc.)

To save disk space and speed, a hard link to the original file is
created in the `moss-input/' folder.

Files of the select process are listed in `tmp/select.out'.

IV. Keep only latest submission

As a user creates multiple submissions for a given assignment, only the
latest one should be kept. Otherwise, a lot of "copy noise" is output by
Moss. Use the `2-latest' script to remove all but the latest assignment
from the transient `moss-input/' folder.

Run the script:
	./2-latest

If you only want to delete files pertaining to a given assignment, pass
the assignment identifier to the script:
	./2-latest 1lin

V. Clean up file to be submitted to Moss

Moss only accepts ASCII files. UTF-8, UTF-16 etc. files have to be
converted.  It would be best if this were handled by the upload system
(i.e. vmchecker).

iconv is run for each non-ASCII file and converted into ASCII:
	./3-clean

As with the select script, a given assignment id may be passed to the
script to only clean up files belonging to that assignment
	./3-clean 1lin

Files are "converted" in place.

VI. Submit files to Moss

Use the check script:
	./4-check

The log provided by Moss is also stored in `moss-output/'. The last line
in the log is an URL pointing to Moss web output.

You may pass a single assignment to the script.
	./4-check 1lin
