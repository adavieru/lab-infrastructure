# This is what to put in /etc/fstab to properly mount Linux/Windows samba shares.
#
# For Linux it's crucial to specify the noperm mount option;
# if you don't, things will work very badly (you'll get permission errors,
# timestamps won't be updated, etc).
#
# Would be nice if a crashed Samba server would to lead to an unresponsive
# desktop, but this is what happens (start VM, mount share, kill VM -- you
# won't be able to umount it). timeo,retry_count don't seem to help much.
